```{r setup, include=FALSE}

require(tidyverse)

## Model 1 SIMS~ARM
### Scarttered Plot
```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))

```
```{r}
basicNN + geom_point() + ggtitle("SIMS vs ARM") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20))
```

Some of the dots in this scatter plot are exhibiting a diagonal upward trend, which indicates a positive association. This statistic demonstrates the workers' expected arm strength from the simulation. This indicates that the majority of the population should have arm strength between 50 and 100.
